This is the project for the Applied Machine Learning at Columbia, which uses the approach of ExplainableAI for making inferences and predictive analysis using embedding and AutoML approach.

Things to keep in Mind:-
1. You can use requirements.txt if you want the exact packages that we might use.
2. You can put the csv files into .gitignore so that you don't push the large csv's everytime.
3. Try to work on a seperate branch and merge into the main one, while taking a pull from the main one to maintain the latest code.
